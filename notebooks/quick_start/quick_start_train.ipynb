An `Instance` consists of one or more `Fields`, where each `Field` represents one piece of data used by your model, either as an input or an output. `Fields` well get converted to tensors and fed to your model. The [Reading Data Chapter](https://guide.allennlp.org/reading-data) provides more details on using `Instances` and `Fields` to represent textual data.\r\n",
