# AllenNLP Guide

## Contributing

### Fixing chapter content

Pull requests to fix / improve chapter content are welcome! The chapters are written in markdown, and
you can find them under `chapters/`.  When there's an executable code block, the code for it will be
found under `exercises/`.  For fixing chapter content, those are the only two directories you should
need to worry about in here.

### Requesting new chapters

If there's something you'd like to see in the AllenNLP Guide that's not currently there, we'd love
to hear about it!  Please look at the [currently-open issues for chapter
requests](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-guide/labels/Chapter%20Request).  If what you're
looking for is listed there, please add an emoji reaction to the issue description, so we know what
to prioritize.  If you would like a chapter that's not listed there, feel free to open a new issue
describing what you're looking for.

### Adding a new chapter

If you'd like to contribute a chapter, please let us know in the appropriate github issue (mentioned
above).  Once we've given a green light, just open a PR with a new markdown file under the right
section in `chapters/`, along with a corresponding entry in `src/outline.js`.  See below for info on
how to do local development when writing the chapter.

## Running the app

To start the local development server, install [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)
and then all other dependencies. This should serve up the app on
`localhost:8000`. Please note that the guide is not compatible with the latest
version of Node.js. Currently, the guide requires the Node.js version included
in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-guide/blob/main/Dockerfile.webapp).
On a Mac, installing `node@10` with Homebrew will work.

```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli  # Install Gatsby globally
npm install                # Install dependencies
npm run dev                # Run the development server
```

### Formatting

This app uses REVIZ-preferred code formatting. To ensure components are formatted correctly, you can run the following command to check and fixing linting issues before committing changes.

```
npm run lint:fix
```

### Mobile Development
If you're developing on a Mac and wish to test changes on an iPhone, the following command will allow the Gatsby server running locally on your machine to be accessed by any device connected to the same Wi-fi network:

```
gatsby develop -H $(hostname) -p 8000
```

Look for the web address and port that the Gatsby server exposes. It should look something like `http://YOUR-COMPUTER-NAME.local:8000/`.

## Dependencies

### Back-end
This app is deployed via [Skiff](https://github.com/allenai/skiff) and code exercises are run via [Binder](https://mybinder.org) and [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab).

### Front-end
Like most AI2 web apps, the front-end is powered by the [Varnish](https://github.com/allenai/varnish) UI component library and its dependencies ([React](https://reactjs.org/), [Ant Design](https://ant.design/), and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)).

Unlike most AI2 web apps, package management is handled via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) instead of Yarn, and the routing and static site generation is driven by [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) instead of NextJS. This app also does not use TypeScript, as it was not included in the template that this app was forked from.

Read-only code blocks are rendered with [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) and interactive code blocks are rendered with [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/).

See [`package.json`](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-guide/blob/master/package.json) for list of all packages used in this app.

## Static assets

All files added to `/static` will become available at the root of the deployed
site. For example, `/static/diagram.svg` can be referenced in the guide as `/diagram.svg`.

## Chapters

Chapters are placed in [`/chapters`](/chapters) and are Markdown files
consisting of `<exercise>` components. They'll be turned into pages, e.g.
`/overview`. In their frontmatter block at the top of the file, they need to
specify `type: chapter`, as well as the following meta:

```yaml
---
title: The chapter title
description: The chapter description
type: chapter # important: this creates a standalone page from the chapter
---
```

### `outline.js` and Chapter Organization

Chapter navigation is rendered programmatically via [`outline.js`](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-guide/blob/master/src/outline.js). Chapters are grouped into "parts," as can be seen in the structure of the outline data object. There is a special chapter called Overview that always appears as the first top-level item in the outline.

Each part supports the following properties:

| Property       | Type             | Description                                                                     |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`        | string           | Unique part title.                                                              |
| `description`  | string           | Part description.                                                               |
| `chapterSlugs` | array of strings | List of chapter slugs                                                           |
| `icon`         | string           | Optional icon (defaults to 'default').                                          |
| `antMenuIcon`  | string           | Optional [Ant Icon](https://ant.design/components/icon/) for use in outline nav |
| `color`        | string           | Optional color (defaults to 'default')                                          |

## Custom Elements

When using custom elements, make sure to place a newline between the
opening/closing tags and the children. Otherwise, Markdown content may not
render correctly.

### `<exercise>`

Container of a single exercise.

| ------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | number / string | Unique exercise ID within chapter.                             |

```

## Setting up Binder

The [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) in the repository defines the
packages that are installed when building it with Binder. You can specify the
binder settings like repo, branch and kernel type in the `"juniper"` section of
the `meta.json`. If modifying these fields, it is recommended that you run the very
first build via the interface on the [Binder website](https://mybinder.org), as
this gives you a detailed build log and feedback on whether everything worked as expected.
Enter your repository URL, click "launch" and wait for it to install the dependencies
and build the image.
