<exercise id="1" title="Coming soon to part 2">

Is there a part of AllenNLP that you find confusing, or would like to learn more about, and we don't
have a chapter on it yet?  [Let us
know!](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-guide#requesting-new-chapters)

These are chapters that are currently under construction for part 2:

* Testing your code: Recommendations and utilities for testing NLP code
* Building a demo: Predictors, and designing code with demos in mind
* Writing your own script as an entry point to AllenNLP

These are chapters that we'd like to write soon:

* Training and evaluating your model (Trainer, Optimizers, and related abstractions)
* Interpreting your model’s predictions (How to use AllenNLP Interpret)

</exercise>


<exercise id="2" title="Coming soon to part 3">

Is there an NLP task that you would like to do with AllenNLP, but you're not sure how?
[Let us know!](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-guide#requesting-new-chapters)

These are some of the things that we could write about for part 3:

* Semantic parsing (in progress)
* Zero-shot text classification
* GANs and other alternating losses
* Sequence labeling
* Language modeling
* Sentence pair classification
* Span classification
* Syntactic parsing
* Reading comprehension
* Sequence to sequence models

If there is one of these that you'd particularly like to see, or one that's not on this list that
you'd like to have added, we'd like to know about it.
