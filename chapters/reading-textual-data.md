<exercise id="1" title="Fields and instances">

## Fields

A `Field` contains a piece of data of particular type. `Fields` get converted to a tensor in a model, either as an input or an output, after being converted to IDs and batched & padded. 

There are many types of fields in AllenNLP depending on the type of data they represent. Among them, the most important is `TextFields`, which represents a piece of tokenized text. [A chapter on representing text as features](/representing-text-as-features) will give you a deep dive into `TextFields` and related concepts.

Other commonly used fields include:

* `LabelField` is a categorical label. We used this for representing text labels in [Part 1 — quick start](/your-first-model).
* `MultiLabelField` is an extension of `LabelField` that allows for multiple labels. This can be used for, e.g., multilabel text classification.
* `SequenceLabelField` is a sequence of categorical labels. This can be used for, e.g., representing gold labels in sequential labeling tasks.
* `SpanField` is a pair of indices that represent a span of text. This can be used for, e.g., representing spans for reading comprehension.

`Fields` can be created simply by supplying the data. `Field` objects provide APIs for creating empty fields, counting vocabulary items, creating tensors, and batching tensors, among others. See the following code snippet for more detail.

## Instances

An instance is the atomic unit of prediction in machine learning. In AllenNLP, `Instances` are collections of `Fields`, and datasets are collections of `Instances`.

* Instances
    * what they are, how to create them, how they fit with the rest of the AllenNLP pipeline
    * (a diagram showing how fields and instances are related, with the rest of the pipeline)
